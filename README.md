# Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics reports
 
 **Authors**: Federica Benassi and Chiara Ventrucci
 
 This repository contains the reports and codes of the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics course activities (all the reports are written in Italian):
 
 1) [Analysis of meteorogical data from stations](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Laboratory-of-Atmospheric-Physics/blob/main/G2_E1.pdf): in this experience we analysed the time series of meteorological data collected from the three stations on the roof of Physics department in Bologna.
 
 2) [Calibration of a tilting rain gauge](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Laboratory-of-Atmospheric-Physics/blob/main/G2_E2.pdf)
 
 3) [Analysis of precipitation data](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Laboratory-of-Atmospheric-Physics/blob/main/G2_E3.pdf): precipitation data of different origin (pluviometric and satellite-derived) have been compared through the analysis of correlation and statistical indices.
 
 4) [Analysis of atmospheric aerosol concentrations](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Laboratory-of-Atmospheric-Physics/blob/main/G2_E4.pdf): we analysed a time series of aerosol concentration and their distribution by using two optical counters of different accuracy.
 
 5) [Analysis of 3D fluxes through a sonic anemometer](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Laboratory-of-Atmospheric-Physics/blob/main/G2_E5.pdf): the time series of the three wind components, obtained by a sonic anemometer, has been analysed.
